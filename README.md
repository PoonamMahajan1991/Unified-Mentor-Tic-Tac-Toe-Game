Project about - 
This is the short readme that how I approach this small project.
The provided code is for a simple, mobile-responsive interactive quiz app built using html, css, and javascript.
Here's a brief description of the code:

HTML(index.html): The html file sets up the structure of the game. Basically I made the structure layout with  
container, cells, divs,buttons,basic headings. It includes a game board, a message to display the current 
player's turn, and a result, restart button. The game board is a 3x3 grid where players can place x or o marks.

CSS(style.css): The css file contains styling rules for the game elements. It ensures that the game board 
and buttons have an attractive layout. Cell elements in the game board are styled as squares with proper 
spacing and a hover effect on the restart button. Then I finish rest basic styling. And last but not the least 
I used media queries for basic responsiveness.

Javascript (script.js): The javascript code controls the game's logic and interaction. It tracks the current 
player (x or o), updates the display message, and handles player moves on the board. It checks for win 
conditions and a draw, updating the message accordingly. 
If all spaces are filled, the game ends in a draw.
The restart button allows players to start a new game.

This code provides a foundation for a basic Tic-Tac-Toe game that can be played on both desktop and mobile 
devices. Users can take turns, and the game determines the winner or a draw.
